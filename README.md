## What is Tantest?

Tantest is an application written in Java and based on android operative system. 
The word Tantest make alusion to the own nature of the applicaton as it's an acronym from
Tanaj and Test, so it's an application where you can make small tests or quizzes about the Tanaj or most commonly known in western countries as the Bible.

The other part of the application allow users to add contacts, create new conversations and share with them the test you make.

The application has two main components, the client side which is the application itself and from which can get the sources here.
The other component is the server to which the application connects to. The server is not available yet.

## How does it work?

First, you need to download the tantest application file, or just generate it from sources. Once you have installed it on your phone,
go to it and the first step is to register. First time, you can only register an account by using a phone since it's sent a sms to your phone to create your account.
Later, you can register other devices as tablets, by registering an email.

Then, once you have an account/phone registered, you can start a 1)new test or you can start a 2)new conversation. This can be achieved
by touching the two small icons on the top-right corner of the device's screen respectively. Let's see each of them in detail.
